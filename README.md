# Unnecessary Type Assertion in TypeScript

This example showcases a common error in TypeScript: using type assertions when they are not needed. TypeScript's type inference system is robust and usually handles type determination automatically.  Overuse of type assertions can lead to less readable and maintainable code.

## Bug

The original `bug.ts` file contains unnecessary type assertions. These do not add value and may even mask underlying type issues that TypeScript's compiler might otherwise detect.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.ts` file demonstrates the solution. The unnecessary type assertion is removed, resulting in cleaner and more efficient code.  TypeScript's compiler correctly infers the type without any additional help.
